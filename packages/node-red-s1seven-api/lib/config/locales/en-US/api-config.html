  <h1>S1Seven API configuration node</h1>
  <p>
    A simple node that allows you to configure the variables necessary to
    interact with the S1Seven UI.
  </p>
  <p>
    By setting the variables once here, they are automatically made available to
    all the S1Seven API nodes.
  </p>

  <h2>Details</h2>

  <p>
    <code>environment</code> allows you to select <code>staging</code> or
    <code>production</code> to choose which environment you wish to use.
    Defaults to <code>production</code>. Learn more about our environments
    <a href="https://developers.s1seven.com/docs/environments/">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Name allows you to customise the name of your configuration, allowing you to
    have multiple configurations. Name must be unique.

    Client Id is necessary for the token generation process. Learn more about

    Client Secret is necessary for the token generation process. Learn more
    about how to find your Client Secret here:

  </p>

  <p>
    Api Version allows you to select which version of the S1SEVEN you want to
    use. Currently, only version <code>1</code> is possible.
  </p>

  <h3>Overridding</h3>
  <p>
    The admin ui can be found by double-clicking on any S1Seven API node,
    selecting the option "Add new api-config" and clicking on the edit button.
    Any variables passed in via the <code>msg</code> object will have priority
    over the values found in the admin ui. This allows the values to be
    overridden dynamically if necessary. For example, if both
    <code>msg.clientId</code> and an access token added via the admin ui are
    present, <code>msg.clientId</code> will be used instead of the admin ui
    access token.
